### This program presents and tests a sorting algorithm
A vector of random integer numbers is generated according to user input, then sorted using
the algorithm. Finally the result is tested by comparing each two successive elements. The
program also uses chrono.h to compare the algorithm's performance to the sorting algorithm
in the C++ Standard Library
